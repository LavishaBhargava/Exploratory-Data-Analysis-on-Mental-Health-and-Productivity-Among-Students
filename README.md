# 🧠 Mental Health & Productivity EDA Project

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset related to students' **mental health, lifestyle habits, and productivity levels**. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that can inform wellness strategies and personal development.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `mental_health_productivity_.xlsx` – The dataset
- `EDA_Mental_Health_Productivity.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook
- `README.md` – This file

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed:

1. Data Cleaning:

-Removed missing values.

-Standardized gender entries for consistency.

-Ensured correct data types.

2. Univariate Analysis:

-Distribution of individual numerical features like sleep hours, screen time, and stress levels.

-Histograms showed common ranges and data spread.

3. Bivariate Analysis:

-Correlation heatmap revealed strong/weak relationships between variables.

For example, screen time and stress level had a mild positive correlation.

4. Categorical Analysis:

-Boxplots showed how categorical variables (Gender, Diet Quality, Social Media Usage) influence stress and productivity.

## 📈 Key Insights:

- Higher screen time correlates with stress.
- Good sleep and diet quality support better productivity.
- Social media overuse is weakly linked with higher stress.
- Gender-wise variation in productivity is minor but visible.

## 💻 Tools Used:

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion:
Lifestyle factors significantly influence students’ mental health and productivity. This analysis highlights the importance of balanced routines, healthy eating, and limiting screen time to maintain well-being and performance.
